# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At the start, my estimates were often quite off. I would underestimate
how long a task would take, especially when something looked simple but 
ended up needing more time to do the task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the Trimester went on, my estimates became little realistic for prac_09 because I got
better at understanding how much time I usually spend writing, testing, and
cleaning up my code. But, I feel that I still need to work on my estimate accuracy as, my actual time
in most practicals was more than the estimate time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating time isn’t about guessing, it’s about understanding my own workflow.
It helped me see where I waste time and how long coding actually takes.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Getting feedback from others showed me small things I often miss, like docstring consistency or formatting.
It also helped me understand how other students approach the same problems differently.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing reviews made me more observant about readability and structure. It’s easier to spot issues in someone
else’s code, and that made me think more carefully about how I write my own programs

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 06](https://github.com/Aafsar774/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

In this review, I gave feedback on hardcoding and how to simplify repetitive code.
I also mentioned improving docstrings to make the purpose of each function clearer.
Moreover, I highlighted the importance of PEP 8.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 08](https://github.com/jc972155/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

I focused on readability and suggested separating logic into smaller, single-responsibility functions.
I also checked for docstrings and missing practical deliverable files.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

This subject practicals have been designed so well by Professor Lindsay that it doesn't need any change according to me.
The practical task sheets are detailed, helpful, and easy to follow. He has given a lot of instruction that if someone pays 
attention they will be able to do it correctly. If I was a charge of this subject, I would be appreciating his valuable contribution to CP1404.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I kept up with the work every week by submitting on time and made sure to commit regularly with clear messages. 
I also got better at using functions properly and following the CP1404 programming patterns.
