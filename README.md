## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Write small, single-purpose functions: Each function should do one thing well and be clearly named based on its action.  
- Use meaningful, consistent naming: Variable, function, and class names should describe their purpose clearly to improve readability.  
- Refactor and test: Make small, frequent commits, and apply the “Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)” principle.
